                <h2>What is "Hack the Burgh"?</h2>
                <p>Hack the Burgh is a hackathon where students come together, team up and collaborate to build cool stuff with data and challenges provided by our sponsors.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
                <p><strong>Hack the Burgh is completely free to attend.</strong> However, tickets are extremely limited and are only available on a first-come-first-serve basis. We recommend that you register your interest as soon as possible so you can get the heads up when they come online the quickest</p>

                <h2>Do I need to have a team beforehand?</h2>
                <p>You're welcome to make a team before the event. But loads of people come without a team. At the start of the event, we'll help everyone find a team. Your team members can be from other Universities. One of the best things about hackathons is meeting hackers from all over the country.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h2>I've never written a line of code. Help?</h2>
                <p>Even more the reason to come! We'll have mentors on site to show you the ropes, and you'll probably get picked up by a team of hackers who can teach you a whole load in a short amount of time. Everyone is friendly and ready to help. Just be ready for some intense learning!</p>

                <h2>Hackawhat?</h2>
                <p>A hackathon is a ~24 hour long programming event. Hundreds of passionate students come together, form teams, share ideas, and help each other build innovative applications. It's a fantastic opportunity to meet new people, learn from mentors, and make cool stuff. They're very beginner friendly. Everybody is there to help each other and have fun.

                <h2>Does everyone on my team have to be from the same Uni?</h2>
                <p>Nope! In fact we encourage people to try and collaborate with people from different places and backgrounds - it often makes for more interesting hacks and is an awesome way of meeting people.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h2>What do I need to bring?</h2>
                <p>A laptop is pretty much essential... Some adventurous types bring desktops although there's not nearly enough space for everyone to do that. Probably a phone charger, assorted cables and anything else for electronics you're bringing. Warm and comfortable clothes, given the amount of time you're at the event... Toiletries and a change of clothes are important too! (Also please don't bring extension leads - The power system won't be able cope with more load). There <strong>will</strong> be engineers and recruiters from a bunch of companies here as well so if you're looking for a Job or Internship you might consider touching up your CV.</p>

                <p>Teams can be any size up to four people - Over that and you're not eligible for any of the prizes. Remember that smaller teams will have to do more per head than larger teams.</p>

                <h2>Hardware Hacks</h2>
                <p>We are super excited to be able to have a ton of hardware available to hack on - Oculus rifts, Leap motions, Thalmic Myos, Pebble smart watches and more! We'd just ask that people don't bring soldering irons, heat guns and other power tools, as those will almost certainly soak people with the sprinkler system.</p>

                <p>Sorry, nope. We require teams that want to be eligible for prizes don't write a single line of code before the hack. This is cheating and won't go down well with the other teams - unless you don't want to compete but where's the fun in that?!</p>

They are all required to agree with <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org/majorleaguehacking">this code of conduct.</a> You should read this code. Organisers will enforce it throughout the event.</p>

                <p>Sure, we'll be sleeping people in the auditorium away from the hacking. Just make sure you bring everything you need to be comfortable - there aren't any beds. But It's a proper hackathon - a lot of people will work through the night!</p>

                <p>MLH can put on coaches if there are enough people (around 30-40) needing return transport to Edinburgh - We'll keep people informed if coaches got arranged.</p>

                <p>Yeah! We'd really appreciate anyone who wants to help make the hack possible reaching out. Hackathons are awesome for those that hack but also a really great platform to display who you are and what you do to a bunch of students that are clearly showing they love to make cool stuff.
